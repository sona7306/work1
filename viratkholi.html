        <p4>Virat Kohli‚Äôs parents played a pivotal role in shaping his character and career. His father, Prem Kohli, was a criminal lawyer known for his discipline and integrity. More than just a parent, Prem was Virat‚Äôs biggest supporter. He would accompany young Virat to practice sessions, even during the harsh winters of Delhi, ensuring that his son never missed training. Tragically, Prem Kohli passed away in 2006 due to a brain stroke when Virat was just 18. His untimely death left a deep emotional impact on Virat but also strengthened his resolve to succeed and honor his father‚Äôs sacrifices.

Saroj Kohli, Virat‚Äôs mother, has been the emotional backbone of the family. A homemaker by choice, she nurtured her children with love and resilience, especially during the tough times following her husband‚Äôs demise. Her gentle nature and constant encouragement have always provided a safe space for Virat to return to, no matter the highs or lows of his career. Even today, Saroj remains a strong presence in his life, often seen supporting him during key matches and events.</p4>
